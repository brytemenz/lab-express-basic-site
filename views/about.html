        <h1>About Ousman Umar</h1>
        <p>
          It is said that our childhood leaves a permanent mark on us for all
          our life, except in my case, it was a stage where there wasn’t space
          for this to develop. I was born in Africa, in a village called Fiaso,
          Ghana, on a Tuesday in 1988. As a child, I had very little to enjoy,
          so I had to invent my own toys and games. When I was thirsty I had to
          go to the river to fetch water. My house had nothing. If I wanted to
          eat fish, I had to fish for it in the river. I was the son of the
          shaman of our village and I sometimes had to go into the jungle to
          look for specific plants to cure the illnesses of the people from the
          surrounding villages.
        </p>

        <p>
          It all began one day while I was playing soccer with my friends after
          taking care of the animals. Suddenly I saw an airplane flying overhead
          and I thought: “how is it possible that an airplane is up there
          flying? If I take anything and throw it in the air it falls to the
          ground, so how is it possible that this doesn’t happen with the
          airplane?” I compared this with the toys that I had made and those
          that I had to drag along the ground if I wanted them to move. I was
          once told that people with white skin were the ones that could fly
          planes.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this day on, I began to think that the world existed way beyond
          my place of birth. So, I started to move outside of the boundaries of
          my village. I envisioned the white man as a god because Europe was
          considered a “paradise” and I was convinced that the “white man” was a
          synonym of intelligence, a doctor, and engineers… to sum it up, as
          superior beings. This idea did not strengthen my thoughts, but it was
          the first time that the idea entered my mind to leave my country in
          order to get to know the white man.
        </p>

        <p>
          A couple of years later I was able to get a job in a nearby village.
          After this, I moved to the second capital of the country and finally
          arrived at the port in the capital city, Accra. It was there I was so
          fortunate to watch television for the first time in my life. It was on
          that same day that Barça happened to be playing. As I had been working
          at the port, I often saw ferries, cars and machines in general. From
          this moment on, my interest to get to know the white man grew more and
          more. I kept wondering how they were able to create and develop such
          amazing things.

          I was only 12 years old at that time, illiterate too, dreaming about a
          continent that I couldn’t travel to. I worked as a welder. My hands
          and body were small and stable which allowed me to enter into the
          complex machinery where welding wasn’t at all simple.

          One day I heard someone talking about Libya. I was told that if I
          moved there, I would earn more money which I found impossible due to
          the fact that until that moment in Accra my salary only allowed me to
          buy one bowl of rice per day. Needless to say, I accepted the offer.
